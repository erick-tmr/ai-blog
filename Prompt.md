create a new blog application

Requirements:

- The application should have a home page that displays all the blog posts.
- The application should have a page for each blog post that displays the post's content.
- The application should have a page for creating a new blog post.
- The application should have a page for editing a blog post.
- The application should have a page for deleting a blog post.

You dont need to create an authentication system. any user with access to the application can create, edit and delete blog posts.
Also, any user can view all the blog posts.

Keep the UI minimal and clean.

Technologies to use:

- Ruby on Rails
- Tailwind CSS
- Stimulus
- Hotwire
- Turbo
- SQLite

Use the latest version of Ruby on Rails, also use rbenv to install it.
You are already in the ai-blog directory, so you don't need to create a new directory for the project. use this directory. it is located in the root of the project. the path is ~/Code/ai-blog

You can do your job interactively. ask for clarification if needed.
